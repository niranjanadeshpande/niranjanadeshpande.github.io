I'm Niranjana, and I'm a computing and information sciences Ph.D. candidate at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/). I am advised by [Dr. Naveen Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nsharma2/) and fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Mohamed Wiem Mkaouer](https://mkaouer.net/author/mohamed-wiem-mkaouer/), [Dr. Ernest Fokoue](https://www.rit.edu/directory/epfeqa-ernest-fokoue) and [Dr. Qi Yu](https://www.rit.edu/mining/qi-yu).  

I conduct interdisciplinary research at the intersection of software engineering and machine learning. Specifically, (1) I study how evolutionary algorithm performance varies when applied to hard software engineering problems, (2) Leverage statistical ML techniques to derive insights and recommend algorithms at a fine-grained, problem-instance level, and (3) Use these models to design systems that dynamically select algorithms to improve computational resource usage. 

Before joining RIT, I was an undergraduate student at the [Cummins College of Engineering for Women](https://www.cumminscollege.org/academics/departments/computer-engineering/), where I earned my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering.
