I'm Niranjana, and I'm a computing and information sciences Ph.D. candidate at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/). I am advised by [Dr. Naveen Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nsharma2/) and fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Mohamed Wiem Mkaouer](https://mkaouer.net/author/mohamed-wiem-mkaouer/), [Dr. Ernest Fokoue](https://www.rit.edu/directory/epfeqa-ernest-fokoue) and [Dr. Qi Yu](https://www.rit.edu/mining/qi-yu).  

I conduct interdisciplinary research at the intersection of software engineering and machine learning. Specifically, (1) I study how evolutionary algorithm performance varies when applied to hard software engineering problems, (2) Leverage statistical ML techniques to derive insights and recommend algorithms at a fine-grained, problem-instance level, and (3) Use these models to design systems that dynamically select algorithms to improve computational resource usage. So far, I've studied the benefits of evolutionary algorithms for constructing service-oriented systems and recommending APIs during library migration. Our paper on [self-adaptive service-oriented systems using algorithm selection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9590318) won the [best paper award at IEEE ICWS 2021](https://conferences.computer.org/services/2021/awards/).

Before joining RIT, I was an undergraduate student at the [Cummins College of Engineering for Women](https://www.cumminscollege.org/academics/departments/computer-engineering/), where I earned my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering.
